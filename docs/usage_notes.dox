/**
 * @page usage Usage Notes
 *
 * - The functions are designed to be generic and extensible.
 * - It's recommended to use `std::chrono::microseconds` or `milliseconds` for higher precision.
 * - Sample containers must have a `.size()` member and be iterable.
 * - Generators must accept the signature `(std::vector<T>&, size_t)`.
 *
 * @note The toolkit is intended for reproducible and educational benchmarking.
